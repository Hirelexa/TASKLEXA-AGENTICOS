# TASKLEXA AGENTICOS

**One Goal. The Right Agents. Governed Execution.**

Tasklexa Agenticos is planned as a sector-agnostic AI agent orchestration
platform. The platform owns mission planning, agent selection, approvals,
verification, and state transitions. External systems provide capabilities
through adapters and must be clearly marked as `LIVE`, `MOCK`,
`NOT_CONFIGURED`, or `FAILED`.

## Current Phase

Phase 5 (Agent Registry and Capability Resolver) is complete. Five generic,
sector-agnostic agent definitions are seeded and queryable via
`GET /agents`, and `POST /missions/{id}/team-plan` dynamically resolves a
mission's required capabilities against them (and against tools, once any
exist). Awaiting approval to begin Phase 6 (Neo4j Mission Graph).

## Local Development

```bash
cp .env.example .env
docker compose up
```

Local URLs once the stack is up:

- Mission Control: http://localhost:3000
- API health: http://localhost:8000/health
- Integration health: http://localhost:8000/health/integrations

If ports 5432/6379/7474/7687 are already used by other local services (common
on dev machines), override `POSTGRES_HOST_PORT`, `REDIS_HOST_PORT`,
`NEO4J_HTTP_HOST_PORT`, and `NEO4J_BOLT_HOST_PORT` in `.env`; only the
host-published ports change, container-to-container networking is unaffected.
